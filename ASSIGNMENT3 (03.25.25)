Questions (due 25th March)
Statistical Methods II: Week 9 Assignment (due 24 March, 2025)

1. Derive the Method of Moments estimator of the rate parameter of the Poisson distri-
bution.

2. Derive the Method of Moments estimators of the mean and the variance parameters
of the Poisson distribution.

3. Derive the Method of Moments estimators of the mean and the variance parameters
of the Gamma distribution.

4. Derive the Method of Moments estimators of the shape and the scale parameters of
the Gamma distribution.

5. Suppose the random variables Y, X1, X2, . . . , Xk have mean vector μ and varaince-
covariance matrix Σ, partitioned as μ =(μY μX)T, Σ =(σ2Y ΣYX, ΣXY ΣXX), where μY and (σY)^2 are the mean and the variance of Y.
What are the method of moments estimators of β = (ΣXX)^-1ΣXY and β0 = μY + βT(X −μX), where X is the column vector
with elements X1, X2, . . . , Xk? You may assume that the joint distribution of the
random variables are defined with any restriction on the matrix Σ, except that it is positive definite.

6. Suppose εY |X = Y − μY − ΣYX(ΣXX)^-1(X − μX), where the notations and assumptions of
Question 5 are used. Suppose further that for another random variable Z, we similarly
define εZ|X. What is the best linear prediction of εY |X in terms of εZ|X, which minimizes
the mean squared error of prediction?

7. In Question 6, what is the partial correlation of Y and Z, after adjustment for the
linear effects of X?
