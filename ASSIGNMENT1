QUESTIONS: (due 17 March, 2025)
1. The data set leprosy available in the R package lmreg (taken from Senedecor and
Cochran, 1967) contains pre- and post-treatment scores on abundance of leprosy for
patients receiving treatments A, D or F (Placebo). Fit a regression model for the
post-treatment score on the treatment regarded as a ‘factor’ with three levels, and plot
the residuals against the pre-treatment score.
2. For the data set of Question 1, fit a regression model for the pre-treatment score on the
treatment regarded as a ‘factor’ with three levels, and plot the residuals of Question 1
against the residuals of this regression. [This is called a partial regression plot.]
3. Find the partial correlation between the post-treatment score and the pre-treatment
score.
4. Compare the partial correlation of Question 3 with the correlation between the two
variables. Do you expect the observed order between the two correlation to prevail in
other data sets too?
5. Obtain the partial regression of the post-treatment score on the pre-treatment score,
and comment on the regression coefficients.

ANSWERS:
#1
library(lmreg)
data("leprosy")
lm1<-lm(post~treatment,data=leprosy)
summary(lm1)
y1<-lm1$residuals
x<- leprosy$pre
y<-leprosy$post
plot(x,y1,xlab="pre-treatment scores",ylab = "residuals on post-treatment scores",main = "Correlation plot 1")

#2
library(lmreg)
data("leprosy")
lm2<-lm(pre~treatment,data=leprosy)
summary(lm2)
y2<-lm2$residuals
plot(y2,y1,xlab="residuals on pre-treatment scores",ylab = "residuals on post-treatment scores",main = "Partial Correlation plot ")

#3
cor(y1,y2)

#4
cor(x,y)

#comment:Yes,in most cases, the partial correlation (controlling for treatment) 
#will be lower than the Pearson correlation (simple correlation between pre- and
#post-treatment scores)

#Reason:

#a. Pearson correlation measures the overall relationship between pre- and post-
#treatment scores, without adjusting for treatment effects.

#b. Partial correlation isolates the relationship between the two scores after 
#removing the effect of treatment, which often weakens the correlation.

#c. Treatment introduces variability—if treatment has a strong effect, the raw 
#correlation between pre- and post-treatment scores might be high simply because 
#both scores are indirectly influenced by the treatment. 
#Once we adjust for treatment, some of that shared variation disappears.

#Exception: If treatment has no impact on post-treatment scores, then the 
#partial correlation will be nearly equal to the Pearson correlation.

#5
lm3<- lm(y1~y2,data=leprosy)
summary(lm3)
co1<-coef(lm3)
abline(co1[1],co1[2])
#Comment:
#co1[1] is the intercept of the partial regression line
#co2[2] is the slope
