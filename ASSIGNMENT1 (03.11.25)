QUESTIONS: (due 10-11 March, 2025)

1. The data set worldpop available in the R package lmreg contains data on the midyear popu-
lation of the world (in billions) for the years 1981-2000. Assuming that the regression of the
world population (Pop.billion) on the year variable (Year) is a continuous and piecewise linear
function (with a single change point at the year 1990), fit a suitable multiple linear regression
model through an R code, and identify from the output the following: (a) the estimated regression
coefficients, (b) the estimated standard deviation of the error and (c) the value of R-square.

2. Continuing with the data of Question 1, assume that the regression of Pop.billion on Year is a
continuous and piecewise quadratic function, with a single change point at the year 1990. Specify
a multiple linear regression model that captures the above characteristics, clearly identifying the
variables and the regression coefficients.

3. Continuing with the data of Question 1, fit the model of Question 2, identify the estimated
regression coefficients and interpret them.

4. Identify (a) the estimated standard deviation of the error and (b) the value of R-square in the fit
of Question 3, compare with the corresponding values in Question 1 and comment.

5. For which values of the parameters of Question 2 will you conclude that the piecewise linear
model is adequate?

6. Modify the answer to Question 2 with the additional assumption that the derivative of the
piecewise quadratic function is continuous at the change point.

7. Continuing with the data of Question 1, fit the model of Question 6, identify the estimated
regression coefficients and interpret them.

8. Identify (a) the estimated standard deviation of the error and (b) the value of R-square in the fit
of Question 7, compare with the corresponding values in Questions 1 and 4 and comment.

9. For which values of the parameters of Question 2 will you conclude that the derivative of the
piecewise quadratic function is continuous at the change point?

10. The data set leprosy available in the R package lmreg (taken from Senedecor and Cochran,
1967) contains pre- and post-treatment scores on abundance of leprosy for patients receiving
treatments A, D or F (Placebo). Fit a regression model for the post-treatment score, with pre-
treatment score as an explanatory variable and the treatment regarded as a ‘factor’ with three
levels. According to the fitted model, what is the expected post-treatment score of a patient who
has pre-treatment score x and belongs to treatment group (a) A, (b) D or (c) F? [Three different
answers are asked for.]

11. For the data set of Question 10, replace the ‘factor’ treatment by a pair of binary variables that
are indicators of groups A and D, and fit this modified model. According to the fitted model,
what is the expected post-treatment score of a patient who has pre-treatment score x and belongs
to treatment group (a) A, (b) D or (c) F? [Three different answers are asked for.]

12. How will the answers to Question 11 change if the binary variables are chosen as indicators of
groups A and F?

The piece wise model is considered adequate when the coefficients of x^2 are low

eg: in q2-3, they are x6 and x7 and are of the order 10^-4

#lm2 er r² lower than lm3 ar std devn of error in lm3 is more than lm2
#so assuming that deriv is continuous is an unfavourable restriction
